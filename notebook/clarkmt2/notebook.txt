Developed first version of our board very early, we are unsure of mechanical implementation just yet

Few ideas we have,
Plunger, expandable ballast
Pressurize water with resovoir
Accumulator tank
Normal tank with bleed valve

January 31st
Purchased parts for all of these and will use V1 to test

February 20th
Tested all of the above with the initial board (no pressure sensor so used gauge, accumulator tank
is by far the best solution but leaks slightly
water was so powerful it bounced off the wall and landed on the board, shorted MCU and board died
slightly after (RIP)

Ordered parts and began CAD Design, on track for everything, multiple new PCBS designed for trigger
added step encoder to adjust menus, designed dpad and a few other things

made 1 signle ocnnector to IO board - cuts the costs a significant amount.

Changed to screw terminals because a ticker wire guauge was needed

used 5V power for the encoder, and the pressure transducer, it paid off adding this to the board early
new revision has pins rearranged to optimize layout and reudce total number of vias

added 3 leak detection subboards that can be distributed throughout the board

these boards have the GPIO with a pullup resistor, and a sensor pin, the sensors pins are interlaced
with GND pins, the idea is that if water comes across the pins the sensor pins will drop to GND as
the water connects it meaning our GPIO would be active low for a leak being detected. This is our
first design for a leak sensor and we have yet to test it.
We deicded on 3 sensors, one directly near the IO board, one directly near the fill valve, and one on
the bottom of the enclosure for when it is hold in normal firing position. The hope is that with these 3
locations we would get a splash of water before it would be possible to reach the microcontroller
minimizing the possible damage to the system

We also have a very basic sketch that I have attached to my notebook that shows our ideal end enclosure.
