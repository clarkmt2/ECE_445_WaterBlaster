# Project Development Log

---

### **February 9 (Initial Meeting)**
- **Objectives**: Discuss project direction and begin proposal.
- **Outcome**: Agreed on a general outline for the project.

---

### **Week 5**
- Met with Mr. Jack Blevins, who provided valuable insights into both the project and his professional experience.
- Demonstrated the working PCB layout using KiCad.

---

### **Week 8**
- Ordered **Main Board PCB â€“ Version 1**.

---

###  **Week 9**
- Set up the **OLED display driver** and basic firmware.
- Began CAD design of various mechanical parts.


---

### **Week 10**
- Soldered components onto the **main board**.
- Verified successful connection between the **OLED display** and the **STM32 microcontroller**.

---

### **Week 11**
- Performed component-level testing.
- Sent out orders for:
  - **PCB Version 2**
  - **Leak detection sensor boards**
  - **IO board**

---

### **Week 12**
- Verified **SPI communication** between STM32 and the OLED.
- Added:
  - **Settings Page**
  - **Home Page**
- Encountered and debugged:
  1. **Display flickering**
  2. **Step encoder** not adjusting values smoothly

---

###  **Week 13**
- Assembled all components (except the 3D-printed frame).
- Verified water blaster met **high-level performance goals**.
- Issues encountered:
  1. Water **not filling properly**
  2. **Step encoder** not updating **valve timing** correctly

---

###  **Week 14**
- Finalized and assembled **3D-printed frame**.
- Expanded firmware to support **5+ pages** using a **state machine**.
- Resolved prior issues with water fill and encoder responsiveness.
- Began **formal verification** of subsystem requirements.

---

###  **Week 15**
- Continued subsystem verification.
- Completed **final project demonstration**.
